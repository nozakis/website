      <h2>What's the dress code?</h2>
      <p style="font-size:large">
        Nothing strict, but if you want a guideline aim for garden party or cocktail attire. Have fun with it!
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:large">
        The ceremony and cocktail hour will be outdoors, weather permitting, and the reception will be indoors (with AC). Be prepared for humid weather and for walking on grass.
